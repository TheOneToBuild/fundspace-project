We select our partners thoughtfully, consistently evaluate our progress, and adjust strategies when needed. Our resources are small compared to these challenges, so we are unable to fund all requests we receive. In a typical year, about 15 percent of our grants are awarded to first-time grantees and less than one percent come from unsolicited proposals. Grants are made only for charitable, educational, or scientific purposes, primarily from tax-exempt charitable organizations.\n\nRequests for Proposals\nStatus\nActive\nClosed\nThere are currently no open RFPs at this time, please check back again soon.\nStay Connected\nEmail Address\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nSign up for email updates\n\nQuick Links\nCareers\nOur People\nFellowships\nGrantee Portal\nContact\n\n© 2025 The David and Lucile Packard Foundation\nLegal\nContact\nCreative Commons\n\nlinkedin\nfacebook\ninstagram\nyoutube\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
